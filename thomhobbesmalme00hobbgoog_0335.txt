AN Anvnnrlsnnnnr.

“ ans Latine Poem writ by the famous Mr. Thomas Hobs os
Melmsbury, harh got suoh e reputation, that many English
readers had a great desire to be acquainted with it3 for whose

salros it is now translated into English, although without the
knowledge of Mr. Hobs3 who it is hoped will not be dis·
pleased with this attempt, which is lest to others judgments‚
whether well or ill. Reader, Farewell: but do not forget to
peruse that exoellent Tmnslstion of Homer by Mr. Hohs. Ι
think the most exact ond best translation that ereI sow.”
