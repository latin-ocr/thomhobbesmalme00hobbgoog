It is said to have been published in 4⁰⁰ in 1666 : but the Editor

The “ Person of Quality ” seems to have been no great scholar,
and certainly not, as is sometimes supposed, Hobbes himself.
He occasionally mistakes the sense of the Latin: as in the
old woman‘s tale of her father penetrating into the eavern for
a great diatanee on the further side of the river :-

neonem omnnrnnoetoe. Noram
Credere nonanti vetule de patre, qaod olim ete.

And he translates

ο ο Pellaeam imitante arissam.
“like to Serissa tight”

There is an English poem called “ The Wonders of the Peakss‘
written by Charles Cotton, and first puhlished, as Wood says,
in 1681. But it has no resemblance to the poem of Hobbes
A eopy of the 4th edition of Ootton‘s poem published in
1694, is to be found in the librnry of the British Mnseum.

The Titlepage and Advertisement prefixed to the edition of

1678, are given in the two following peges.
