Tms poem, which is represented by our author in his στιγμαὶ,
published in 1657, as having been “made long sinee” (see
vol. vii. p. 389), appears to have been written in the interval
between the sueoession 01 his first pupil, William Lord
Cavendish, to the title 01 Earl of Dewonshire, and his death,
that is to say, between 1626 and 1628 :-

Sed Dominum, mea Musa, eules, eui gente vetusta
Orto dat titulos Devonia, Derbia curas.

e a s a

Tum Dominam spectes a a e
Amborumque vide sobolem3 imprimisque puellam
Dignam qua caleant Superi, binosque puellos
Angelioos a s

lt was probably laid aeide, when Hobbes on the death 01 his
pupil lert the Cavendish family for a while: “nimium neglec-
tus abivit”: (an Carm. exp). And if the date 01 1636 is
eorrectly attributed by Anthony Wood to the first edition, it
was published just before his return from abroad in 1637 with
his second pupil, the son 01 the late Earl.

The only editions that the Editor has met with, are the quarto
edition without date or title-page, which seems to be that to
whieh Anthony Wood assigns the date 01 1636 z and the oe-
tavo edition 01 1678, published by Hobbes’ bookseller, Wil-
liam Creuit, along with an English translation by “ a Person
01 Quality.’'
